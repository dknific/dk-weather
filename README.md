# dk-weather

An update to the classic public API fetch project. I originally made this tacky looking React app to fetch weather info back in 2017, but I figured a total re-build should be in order.

This project uses the OpenWeather public API to fetch weather information based on a given city name.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Get a Free OpenWeather API Key!

First things first: In order to run this repo on your own machine, you'll need to replace the constant here with your own `API key`. Otherwise, just check out the live demo here!

Getting your own OpenWeather API key is simple - just head to [their website and sign up for free!](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


```
yarn start
yarn test
yarn build
```


**yarn build** builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
